# Android Demos

## AccessKey

Cobra requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Cobra SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Activity

Copy your AccessKey into the `ACCESS_KEY` variable in `MainActivity.java` before building the demo.

This demo is intended for applications that need to do voice activity detection when in focus.
