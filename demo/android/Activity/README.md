# Android Activity Demo

This Android demo runs Cobra in the foreground (i.e., when the app is in focus).

## Setup

1. Replace `String ACCESS_KEY = "..."` inside
   [MainActivity.java](cobra-activity-demo-app/src/main/java/ai/picovoice/cobraactivitydemo/MainActivity.java)
   with your AccessKey generated by [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).

```java
private static final String ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE";
```

2. Add  `pvTestingAccessKey = "..."` inside `local.properties`
   with your AccessKey generated by [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).

```console
pvTestingAccessKey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
```

## Usage

Launch the demo on your phone using Android Studio.

1. Press the start button
2. Start talking. The app background will change to indicate that voice activity was detected above the threshold.
