# Android Activity Demo

This Android demo runs Cobra in the foreground (i.e., when the app is in focus).

## Setup

1. Replace `String APP_ID = "..."` inside [`MainActivity.java`](/demo/android/Activity/cobra-activity-demo-app/src/main/java/ai/picovoice/cobraactivitydemo/MainActivity.java) with your AppID generated by [Picovoice Console](https://picovoice.ai/console/).
```java
private static final String APP_ID = "YOUR_APPID_HERE";
```

## Usage

Launch the demo on your phone using Android Studio.

1. Press the start button
2. Start talking. The app background will change to indicate that voice activity was detected above the threshold.
